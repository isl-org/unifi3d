# Generated Datasets 
This is a list of datasets generated by us

## Shapenet with SDFs and point clouds

- Script used for generation is `scripts/data/create_preprocessed_dataset.py`

```
info.json
    - Contains fields 'text', 'file_path', 'id'

mesh.npz
    - vertices (N, 3) float32
    - triangles (M, 3) int32

pointcloud.npz
    - points (40000, 3) float16     All points are sampled on the original mesh surface
    - normals (40000, 3) float16
    - base_color (40000, 3) float16
    - metallic (40000, 1) float16
    - roughness (40000, 1) float16

pointcloud_boundary.npz
    - points (100000, 3) float16     All points are sampled on the mesh surface excluding surfaces that are "inside" according to the sdf value
    - normals (100000, 3) float16
    - base_color (100000, 3) float16
    - metallic (100000, 1) float16
    - roughness (100000, 1) float16

points_iou.npz
    - points (100000, 3) float16    Points sampled uniformly in the unit cube
    - occupancies (12500,) uint8    Packed occupancies

points_iou_0.1.npz
    - points (100000, 3) float16    Points sampled such that 10% of the points are occupied (actal ratio can still be lower for some examples)
    - occupancies (12500,) uint8    Packed occupancies

sdf_grid_128.npz
    - sdf (128, 128, 128) float16

sdf_grid_256.npz
    - sdf (256, 256, 256) float16

sdf_octree_depth_6.npz
    - points (N, 3) float16     4 points sampled for each octree voxel
    - grad (N, 3) float16       The gradient of the sdf
    - sdf (N,) float16          SDF values
```


## Objaverse subset with SDFs and point clouds

The same script is used for generating data from Objaverse `scripts/data/create_preprocessed_dataset.py` with the same output format as described before.

Use the following options for the script to generate the data for the experiments in the appendix
```bash
python scripts/data/create_preprocessed_dataset.py \
    --dataset_root /path_to/hf-objaverse-v1/ \
    --objaverse_json_path /path_to/objaverse_filtered.json data/objaverse_categories_preprocessed \
    --lvis_categories chair seashell shield skateboard mug apple banana
```
